## Technical Scope

In order to help fight the urge of wanting to add more 
and more complex features, I've outlined the scope of 
this engine.

This is a classical, non-relativistic, non-field-theoretic, particle based physics engine.

But what does this mean exactly?
- The most fundamental object is a particle.
- These particles behave dynamically according to $$\frac{d}{dt}\begin{bmatrix}\vec{r} \\\ \vec{p}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\vec{p}/m \\\ \Sigma\vec{F}\end{bmatrix}$$
- There is no massless particle (these are only permitted in a relativistic theory).
- Particles do not possess angular momentum (no intrinsic spin).
- Mass isn't a measure of rest energy, so it is conserved.
- Interactions are non-local, as there are no fields to mediate forces.

This boils it down to only three conservation laws:
- Linear momentum
- Energy
- Mass
