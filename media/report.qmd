# Introduction

The primary goal of the project is to create a general-purpose framework for particle based simulations. Particles are chosen as the primary means of simulation because of their simplicity and generality. Most phenomena in reality can be described by underlying particle dynamics, adding further reason to investigate their use in simulation.

## Background

Because the framework aims to support classical and non-relativistic behavior, the foundations of classical physics must be respected:

- Newton's Laws of Motion
- Conservation Laws (m, E, $\vec{p}$, $\vec{l}$)
- Laws of Thermodynamics

One of the primary issues with using particles as the underlying unit of simulation is the fact that most things that occur at the scale of humans have an order of magnitude of around $10^{24}$ particles involved. Performing any interesting simulation would thus be nearly impossible if each and every particle were to be simulated.

In order to account for this, methods for recovering a continuum from a smaller set of discrete particles will be needed. The most popular method for doing so is Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), which will be the subject of @sec-sph.

## Usefulness

Important systems are often complex and involve many areas of physics merging and interacting. Thus the importance of this project stems from the fact that having a unified framework for physical simulation opens the door to studying situations that involve coupled and interacting phenomena.

Furthermore, having a single general purpose framework that captures a lot of overlapping implementation details would reduce much of the boilerplate and redundancy that is necessary when creating a simulation. Instead of needing a large amount of manual code just to test a new idea or study an important system, one can simply tap into what this framework provides and add any additional behavior as necessary.

# Methods

To remain very general purpose, modular, and extensible, the framework has been created in such a way that allows for any type of particle behavior to easily tap into the system's main update loop. Two different APIs have been created to do so.

The first API is called an `Interaction`, and the entrypoint for an Interaction occurs at the beginning of the main loop, while the second is called a `Constraint`, which occurs after the particle integration step (see @lst-update-loop).

## Interactions

### Particle Dynamics

Force-based simulation is ubiquitous, and is thus an obvious inclusion in a framework such as this one.

As this framework has been created in a modular fashion, anyone can hand-code their own forces and interactions, however, many forces have a lot of implementation details in common.

To reduce repetition, a handful of common force "types" have been pre-implemented, including things such as force potentials, pairwise forces between particles, and forces that arrise due to an interaction with a field.

Many things can be simulated using these forces alone, such as kinetic gases, spring systems, Lennard-Jones fluids, gravity, etc.

### Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {#sec-sph}

Because of the large number of particles participating, macroscopic phenomena are often modelled as continuous. It is thus important to provide a way to recover a continuum from discrete particles. SPH is a method that aims to do so.

Because a particle has finite mass and zero extent, trying to calculate something like density (or another continuum quantity) requires the use of a Dirac-Delta function. Thus the foundational starting point of the SPH method is the following identity:

$$
A(\vec{r}) = \iiint\limits_{\mathbb{R}^3} A(\vec{r}\prime) \delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r}\prime) dV\prime
$$ {#eq-identity}

By recognizing that $dm = \rho dV$, and by substituing an approximation to the Dirac-Delta distribution, called the kernel $W$, we arrive at the following continuous formula:

$$
A(\vec{r}) = \iiint\limits_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{A(\vec{r}\prime)}{\rho(\vec{r}\prime)} W(\vec{r}-\vec{r}\prime, h) dm\prime
$$

A primary constraint on $W$ is that it must approach the Dirac-Delta distribution as $h \rightarrow 0$, giving $h$ the name "the smoothing length." The final step is the discretization. Our spatial domain is sampled by a collection of particles, and so the integral over that domain will become the following discrete sum over the particles:

$$
A(\vec{r}) = \sum_{i}^{N} m_i \frac{A_i}{\rho_i} W(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_i, h)
$$ {#eq-interpolation}

@eq-interpolation is the central equation to the SPH method, as it allows any set of continuum equations to be discretized and for the interpolatation of any continuous field using a set of discrete sampling particles.

A particularly common value that needs to be calculated is the density, so by setting $A(\vec{r}) = \rho(\vec{r})$, we arrive at the following equation:

$$
\rho(\vec{r}) = \sum_{i}^{N} m_i W(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_i, h)
$$ {#eq-density}

In a continuum, the particles experience an acceleration due to the local pressure field^[They also experience other forces such as viscosity, body forces, elasticity, etc, but we can treat all of them as independent.].

$$
\frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho_i}\nabla_{\vec{r}_i}P
$$

Discretizing this force alone will allow us to capture a lot of the behavior of a fluid, and so it will serve as the primary example shown here.

The nice thing about the SPH method is that it allows us to easily calculate gradients by just passing the gradient operator through the summation, leading to:

$$
\frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho_i} \sum_{j}^{N} m_j \frac{P_j}{\rho_j} \nabla W(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j, h)
$$

However, upon further inspection one may notice that the force on particle i due to particle j is not antisymmetric as Newton's Third Law requires for momentum conservation $\vec{F}_{ij} \neq -\vec{F}_{ji}$. To fix this, the following identity can be used:

$$
\nabla(\frac{P}{\rho}) = \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla P - \frac{P}{\rho^2}\nabla\rho
$$

Using this instead, we arrive at the pairwise force that is central to SPH:

$$
\vec{F}_{ij}^{pressure} = -m_i m_j (\frac{P_i}{\rho_i^2} + \frac{P_j}{\rho_j^2}) \nabla W(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j, h)
$$ {#eq-pressure-force}

Given that $\nabla W(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j, h) = -\nabla W(\vec{r}_j-\vec{r}_i, h)$, this pairwise force will conserve momentum. Finally, to close the equations of motion, an equation of state is needed so that pressure can be calculated. A common one in astrophysics is the polytrope $P = K\rho^{\frac{n+1}{n}}$.
